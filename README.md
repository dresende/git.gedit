# Simple Git Integration with Gedit

## Features

The plugin adds 4 buttons to the gedit toolbar:

* Add - same as 'git add' to the active document
* Add Active - same as 'git add' on every open document (in current window)
* Commit - shows a dialog with current staged files and asks for a commit message
* Push - same as 'git push' (origin master) - NOT DONE YET

## Ideas

Have a menu on a toolitem to make some more simples commands:

* Revert file (same as 'git checkout')
* Show log (..)
* Git Pull (?)
* Git Diff (?)
